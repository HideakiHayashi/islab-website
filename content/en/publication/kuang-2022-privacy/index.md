abstract: An increasing amount of face images are being captured, shared, or applied
  in various applications. These images usually contain lots of sensitive information
  that may lead to privacy disclosure and misuse problems. Some pioneering works show
  that face image anonymization is one of the promising solutions. We present an innovative
  identity (ID) camouflage approach by synthesizing anonymous faces so that both artificial
  intelligence algorithms and humans are unable to recognize them and misuse them
  freely. Given a face image, our approach consists of two steps. First, we sample
  an anonymous ID feature point in the feature space. Then, we synthesize a camouflage
  face by training an anonymous deep generative adversarial network model. To reduce
  the risk of re-identification, we optimize our anonymous face generator based on
  the k-nearest neighbors to make a good balance between anonymity and utility of
  the original face image. The experimental results over the public dataset have verified
  the feasibility and state-of-the-art efficacy of our approach.
